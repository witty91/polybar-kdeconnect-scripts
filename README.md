# polybar-kdeconnect-scripts
Found out I could do some stuff with kdeconnect using dbus commands...so I did

currently all scripts in the script folder need the device ID set manually...this could also be automated to the first device (or be made interactive)
then the scripts need to be copied to ~/.config/polybar/scripts/ or the corresponding module files need to be configured with the correct Path.
